# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning, A.Y. 2021-22

Challenges for the Polimi course [Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=743758&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=aecd9011268247a3a38167c06f718c5c).

I worked together with [Riccardo Mencucci](https://github.com/Mencucci); our team was called "team_durian".

### [Challenge 1](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/226)
This challenge was about image classification of leaves using both hand-made networks and transfer learning.

### [Challenge 2](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/621)
This challenge was about multivariate-multistep time-series forecasting. We both tried convolutional (1D) and memory (LSTM, GRU, etc) approaches.
